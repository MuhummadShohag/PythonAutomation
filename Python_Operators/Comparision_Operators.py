#============ Comparision Operators With Values =============

# Greater that - True if left operand is greater than the right
3 > 4 

# Less that - True if left operand is less than the right
3 < 4

# Equal to - True if left operand same the right
3 == 3

# Not Equal to - True if left operand is not same the right
3 != 2

# Greater than or Equal to - True if left operand greater than or equal to the right
3 >= 2

# Less than or Equal to - True if left operand Less than or equal to the right
3 >= 2

#============ Comparision With String =============
# Python compare string base on ASCII Code
'a' == 'a'

'a' == 'b'

'a' != 'a'

'a' < 'b'

# Finding ASCII Code 
ord('a')

# Finding Particular Characters from ASCII Code
chr(97)

'aaa' > 'abc'

'abc' < 'aac'
